# Reversing
## Executable types
- ELF (Extensible Linking Fromat) 

## Packing & obfuscation (making something unclear)
### Executable compression, executable packing
This compression compress the code and the data and adding it to executable file that will decompress the compressed executable. 
This method was used because of space complexity but now it doesnâ€™t matter. 
The main use for it now is to harden hackers to reverse engineer the executable (obfuscation)
